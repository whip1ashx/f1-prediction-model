# 🏎️ F1 Driver Performance Prediction Model

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing historical Formula 1 race data to predict driver performance using statistical and machine learning techniques.  
The goal is to demonstrate end-to-end data analysis skills — from data cleaning and feature engineering to model building and result interpretation.

This is a portfolio project created to simulate a real-world analytics use case in sports analytics.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze historical Formula 1 driver and race data
- Identify key factors influencing driver performance
- Build a predictive model to estimate driver performance
- Present insights through a simple web interface

---

## 🧠 Approach
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**
   - Cleaned and structured race and driver datasets
   - Handled missing values and inconsistent records

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Selected performance-related features such as qualifying position, grid position, and race history
   - Transformed raw data into model-ready format

3. **Modeling**
   - Built a regression-based prediction model
   - Evaluated model performance using standard metrics

4. **Application Layer**
   - Developed a lightweight Flask web app to display predictions
